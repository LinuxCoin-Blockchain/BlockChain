# BlockChain
Collaborative engineering of Linux® Open Source Blockchain.

Welcome!

Everybody is welcome to work in this collaborative engineering project.
Developers participating in this project will receive Linux® Coins and the opportunity to become part of our organization worldwide.

Linux® Blockchain Features

NO MINING
Mining will not be needed on our blockchain, because mining attracts hardware investors to create huge farms. These farms uses fosil sources of energy to produce and waste an enormous amount of electricity, damaging our planet and creating a disproportionate hashrate monopoly against which individuals have no opportunity to compete.

NO GAS FEES NOR TRANSACTION FEES
It is really absurd to pay 50 USD to send 0.01 cent to someone .... Absurd transactions fees because miners are doing whatever they want. This is not going to happen here. It will be free to send and receive payments on our blockchain, because we want to incentive the use of our blockchain to trade cryptocurrencies everyday. Cryptocurrencies are created to be stored and used everyday and everywhere, just like normal currencies. 


ECO-FRIENDLY
We are developing a network where any device can participate, even Raspberries and old cellphones can run a node because Linux® Blockchain Nodes can be installed on any device and it does not require so much energy or resources. We will always promote natural sources of energy to run our Linux® Blockchain Nodes.


EVERYBODY IS WELCOME
Anyone can install and run Linux® Blockchain Nodes. It is free and voluntary to run nodes, and people can also give you a voluntary tip :). voluntary tips. Linux® Blockchain Nodes are very easy to setup.


EASY SMART CONTRACTS
Easy to deploy smart contracts using Solidity object-oriented, high-level language for implementing smart contracts. It will be free to deploy smart contracts.


LINUX® DECENTRALIZED EXCHANGE WITHOUT LISTING FEES
You only need intelligence to run your own projects and we know you have good ideas, but maybe you don't have USD 300.000 to pay listing fees on some exchanges ... Don't worry, you will be able to list your tokens for free and create all trading pairs you want, and the best of all, you no longer need to look for investors to provide liquidity, because our exchange will have automatic liquidity for all of your projects.


RUN YOUR OWN LINUX® DECENTRALIZED EXCHANGE
Are you tired or monopoly and you want to run your own exchange? We offer you everything you need for free! You only need to setup Linux® Exchange Server or Linux® Exchange Script on any server with support for Apache, PHP and MySQL.


LINUX® SWAP
Swap any token from Linux® Blockchain or any other blockchain without paying transactions fees.


LINUX® WALLET
Yes, we are building it ...


LINUX® EXODUS 
Easy to move tokens from other blockchains to Linux® Blockchain, without paying absurd transaction fees.
